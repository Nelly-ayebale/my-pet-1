    <h1>SNOW</h1>

    <p>My cat is named Snow. This is her name because she is white with only a black patch on her head.</p>
    <p>I got her when she was just a kitten and within two years, she has grown to be a healthy grown cat.</p>

    <p>Snow lies in the sun all day and enjoys taking naps in the couch.She enjoys chasing after balls of yawn and also chasing mice around the house.</p>
    <p>She recently gave birth to two kittens where one was given away. However Snow still showed her kitten all the maternal attention a mother could give.</p>
    <p>When she was a kitten, she loved to pounce around a small green ball and also chase small insects but now she rarely even gives the ball attention.</p>
    <p>However, she still chews up on insects</p>

    <p>Snow loves to eat and respects all her meal times. She usually comes running when I call her for food.</p>
    <p>With keen attention to the food I give her she loves Chicken compared to other meats.</p>
    <p>I usually give her the following food:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li>Canned cat food</li>

        <p>However, she rarely eats the Avocadoes.</p>
    </ul>
